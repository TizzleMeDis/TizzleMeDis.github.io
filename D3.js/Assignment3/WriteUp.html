			For this assignment, all three of us were able to work and communicate together to come 
			up with this interactive graph visualization. When we first got together, we first wanted 
			to come into agreement of which dataset we wanted to use. We then decided to use one of our 
			team members dataset from their assignment #2 which contained house prices of every city in 
			California sold from 2000-2020. <br /><br />

			When coming up with the interactive graphic, we all wanted to try to make a geographic map 
			graphic where users can click on the city and it displays information about the house market in 
			that city. However due to the time constraint and us being new to D3, we decided it was not the best 
			idea. After two meetings, we all came up with an alternative to create a bar chart race that 
			displayed the top cities with the highest average price house sold from 2000-2020. As well as this bar 
			chart, we included a histogram that allowed users to select a certain California city and display the 
			average price of houses sold each year from 2000-2020. Once we came to agreement with those two graphics, 
			we discussed how much we were going to filter the dataset. Initially, the dataset had so many cities that 
			it would have taken a long time to filter it out, so we decided to only keep the most well known cities 
			such as San Jose, San Francisco, etc. After making those decisions, we each divided the work between 
			the three of us. <br /><br />

			When dividing up the work, we had one person filtering the csv file down to only have a list of the 
			most well known California cities and their average price and highest price house sold by year. We 
			also worked together on developing the bar chart race and histogram. We helped each other with visual 
			coding by researching through Observable. We then had one person create and host the webpage. In total, this 
			whole process took 2 weeks with each of us spending 2-4 hours a day researching how to use D3 to create our 
			visuals. The aspect that took the most time was using D3 to create our visuals because all of us were new to D3. 
			Another aspect that took the longest was creating and hosting a webpage because we were also fairly 
			new to this. Overall, it was a fun and great learning experience with this assignment.
