			<h4>Description of Static Visual:</h4>
			<article> This visual is a line graph that displays the top five most populated cities from our data and it shows a timeline of their average house prices from 2000 to 2020. The five cities consist of Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose. We determined that these were the top five cities based on how many houses were purchased in that area. Based on this visual, the user can see from the year 2000 to 2006 there has been a steady increase. However, during 2007-2010 there was a drop in house prices which could have been caused by factors such as the 2008 financial crisis. But once we get to 2010s, we see that prices go back up into new highs for all five cities. Using this visual, it emphasizes that the California House market has indeed increased since the year 2000. But it seems to follow a pattern of increasing at first, then a price drop, to then again increasing but to a new high. Based on this visual, many people looking for houses can determine when is the best time to purchase a home in California.</article>
